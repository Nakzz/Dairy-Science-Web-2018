                    <h2>Biography</h2>
                    <p>Dr. Victor E. Cabrera was born and raised in the Inca's land of Cusco, Peru. After finishing High School, he moved to Lima to pursue his B.S. and Engineering degrees from La Molina Agrarian University. After graduation, he worked for three and a half years as an agriculture educator in a college. During that time he completed a 3-month post-graduate course on administration of agriculture schools in Spain and France. In 1997, Victor was awarded a fellowship from the Kellogg Foundation to pursue a M.S. degree in Farming Systems Research and Extension at the University of Florida. His M.S. research focused on improving small farm livelihood systems using alternative agronomic practices, which were evaluated with linear programming techniques. After finishing his M.S. degree, Victor accepted a 6-month interim position at the University of Florida Food and Resource Economics Department.</p>

                    <p>Victor went back to Peru in 1999 where he worked as a consultant in a project of the Inter-American Development Bank for two years. In 2001, he returned to the U.S. to pursue his Ph.D. at the University of Florida School of Natural Resources working as a research and teaching assistant in the Food and Resource Economics Department. During his Ph.D. program, he became deeply involved with dairy industry and dairy farm systems developing a comprehensive decision support system to help dairy producers cope with increasing environmental restrictions while maintaining profitability. In 2004, right after graduating, Victor accepted a Postdoctoral position with the University of Miami, where he worked performing risk analyses of using climate information under government farm programs. In early 2006, Victor accepted the position of Assistant Professor and Extension Dairy Specialist with the New Mexico State University where he worked for two years. During that time, Dr. Cabrera worked performing applied research focused on environmental decision-making for the growing dairy industry in New Mexico and Western Texas.

                    <p>In April 2008, he joined the faculty team of the Dairy Science Department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison as an Assistant Professor and Extension Specialist in Dairy Management with 70% Extension and 30% research appointment split. Victor was tenured and promote to Associate Professor in November 2013.</p>

                    <p>Dr. Cabrera is focusing his extension and research programs on dairy farm economic decision-making for improved profitability and sustainability.

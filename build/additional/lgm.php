	Livestock Gross Margin for Dairy  (LGM-Dairy) is a new risk management tool available for dairy producers. The LGM-Dairy protects a farmer's defined income over feed cost. This insurance program may become an important tool to control increased volatility of milk and feed prices. With uncertain and volatile milk prices and feed costs, there is a greater need for effective risk management strategies that can prevent producer's potential losses due to prices and cost risks. Some risk management tools like futures and option trading can protect producers against low milk prices. However, they do not protect them against high production costs. Furthermore, a better option is a coverage based on the gross margins or protection of the milk income over feed costs rather than milk prices or the feed costs alone. The LGM-Dairy offers a better alternative as a risk management strategy.

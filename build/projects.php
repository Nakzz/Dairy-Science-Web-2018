              <p>This project will develop a "virtual dairy farm brain," a state-of-the-art suite of real-time integrated
                dairy farm management decision support tools. The "virtual dairy farm brain" will mimic actual farm management
                and will learn as it goes by applying complex machine learning pipelines and exploiting the interdependencies
                of the complex integrated biological, physical, and informational dimensions of dairy farm systems.
                The project will determine if a dairy farm can substantially improve its economic and environmental
                performance by interacting, adopting and applying integrated, databased analytics, expert systems, and
                artificial intelligence contained in whole farm decision support tools through the "virtual dairy farm brain."
                This innovative project is anticipated to transform how dairy farms will operate in the future and likely become the
                next big leap in dairy farm management. Dairy farms have embraced technological innovations and procured vast amounts
                of permanent data streams, but the problem is that they have not been able to integrate all this information to improve
                whole farm based management and decision-making. It is imperative to develop a system that can collect, integrate, manage,
                and analyze on-farm and off-farm data in real-time for practical and relevant actions. This project's main assets include
                using existing data - cow, herd, farm, market, weather, crops, and soils - and integrating these data streams to produce new
                knowledge and optimized decision-support tools.
                The project is especially important and relevant to Wisconsin, the largest dairy farm state (10,000 farms), in which dairying
                contributes half of the agricultural economy, has an impact of $43 billion a year, and supports 80,000 jobs. (<a href="../virtualdairyfarmbrain.php" target="_blank">More</a>)</p>

                <p>This project will train 60 small beginning dairy farmers and help them to apply strategic decision-making regarding financial risks via three workshops across Wisconsin. Follow-ups will be established during workshops to later verify and measure positive application of the learning. To facilitate the adoption of new financial risk management strategies, part of the project will involve the creation of a user-friendly computer decision-making suite (i.e., the Wisconsin Benchmark Dairy Ratio tool) which will be used as an instrument of discussion and learning. The Agriculture Financial Advisor (AgFAÂ©) dataset will be the foundation of these computer tools. Related curricula have been delivered across the state using the FAST tools suite from the University of Illinois. Evaluations have indicated that producers have greatly appreciated these trainings, however, they are requesting similar tools be created for Wisconsin's specific conditions.

                  <p>This is an extension and research project is designed to investigate the impacts of pasture supplementation decisions made
                    by Wisconsin organic and conventional grazing dairies on selected economic, production and environmental variables.
                    It is anticipated that organic dairy producers, transitioning producers and even conventional producers will benefit from this
                    project as it identifies the farm level factors that influence pasture supplementation decisions and feed resource management on
                    dairy farms. Project results will be utilized to develop outreach materials and decision aids that will be useful to farmers,
                    extension agents and other agricultural professionals as they assist organic, transition, beginner or grazing dairy producers
                    with farm planning and risk management decisions. (<a href="orei_tmp.php" target="_blank">More</a>) </p>

                  <p>This project will train 60 small beginning dairy farmers and help them to apply strategic
                    decision-making regarding financial risks via three workshops across Wisconsin. Follow-ups will be
                    established during workshops to later verify and measure positive application of the learning.
                    To facilitate the adoption of new financial risk management strategies, part of the project will
                    involve the creation of a user-friendly computer decision-making suite (i.e., the Wisconsin Benchmark
                    Dairy Ratio tool) which will be used as an instrument of discussion and learning. The Agriculture
                    Financial Advisor (AgFAÂ©) dataset will be the foundation of these computer tools. Related curricula
                    have been delivered across the state using the FAST tools suite from the University of Illinois.
                    Evaluations have indicated that producers have greatly appreciated these trainings, however, they
                    are requesting similar tools be created for Wisconsin's specific conditions.

                  <p>The recent history of the U.S. dairy industry can be characterized as one with significant
                    fluctuations in the price of milk at the farm level. Dramatic increases in energy and feed
                    costs have added the new dimension of input price variability contributing to an increasingly
                    risky production and marketing environment. Starting in August 2008 the Livestock Gross Margin
                    for Dairy (LGM-Dairy) insurance program has been added to the list of risk management tools available
                    to Wisconsin dairy farm operators. This insurance program protects against unanticipated declines in
                    gross margins which are defined as milk revenue minus feed costs. LGM-Dairy program could be considered
                    a combination of the use of a put to limit milk price declines and a call to limit feed cost increases.
                    This project will provide a better understanding of this new risk management tool and will develop
                    educational materials to illustrate how LGM-Dairy could be effectively used by a variety of Wisconsin
                    dairy farm operations. We will examine the role of LGM-Dairy for a variety of farm sizes and
                    technologies versus traditional price risk management strategies. We will focus on the implications
                    of alternative biofuels scenarios and climatic conditions.

                  <p>The Specific Aim of this proposal is to assess management strategies to improve cost-efficiency
                    and profitability in Wisconsin dairy farms through participatory research on dairy farms. Systems
                    analyses and operation research will be used to simulate dairy herd systems to test and integrate
                    new technologies and knowledge (e.g., nutrition, reproduction, physiology, health, genetics) for
                    strategic dairy management. Emphasis will be given to artificial intelligence using computer simulation
                    research and the development of custom-made software and a decision support system (DSS) tool, which will
                    be carefully designed, user-friendly, and extensively tested. This project will follow a participatory
                    framework with scientists, dairy producers, Extension agents, and dairy industry consultants to provide
                    research-based farm management responses to current industry needs. The participatory approach will
                    include the development and maintenance of a Web portal as a communication hub in the process of
                    technology transfer.

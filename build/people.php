			<div class="sp-dsc">
				Hector Delgado got his Bachelorâ€™s degree in Veterinary Medicine from Universidad de Caldas in Manizales, Colombia.
															After working for a short period of time as Agricultural Projects Officer in a Colombian bank,
															he continued with his MBA studies at Universidad Santo Tomas in Bucaramanga, Colombia.  Immediately after that Hector got a faculty position at the Veterinary Medicine and Animal
																Science School of Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia in Bucaramanga (Colombia). After various years,
																he was appointed by World Animal Protection (former WSPA) as Veterinary Programs Manager for South America
																where he had the opportunity to introduce the concept of animal welfare in various Veterinary and Animal Science
																Schools of the region.  Although his work was very fulfilling, he had the need to continue with his education and
																he moved to Montreal (Canada) where he completed his PhD under the guidance of Dr. Kevin Wade studying longevity
																and profitability of dairy cows.  Currently Hector is working as Research Associate (Postdoc), under the guidance
																of Dr. Cabrera, participating at the UW2020 virtual dairy farm brain project.
